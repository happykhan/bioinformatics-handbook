# About this week - Objectives and learning outcomes

This week will cover genome sequence analysis. Topics include:

* Sequence alignment and homology searches
* Microbial genome assembly (single isolate)
* Comparing the impact of short read vs long read sequencing on microbial genome assembly (single isolate)
* Quality control of microbial genome assembly (single isolate)
* Microbial genome annotation (single isolate)
* Basic detection of virulence factors (single isolate data only)

Each submodule (listed in the [programme]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/sequence-analysis/programme/)) will have a brief introduction, followed by a practical exercise. The practical exercises will use real world data (or simulated data that mimics real world data). You are expected to guide yourself through the material but you are encouraged to ask questions of the instructors.

# Learning outcomes 

* Understand the principles of sequence alignment and homology searches. 
* Be able to produce a *de novo* microbial genome assembly. 
* Understand the difference of long read and short read seqeunce data. 
* Be able to assess the quality of a microbial genome assembly. 
* Understand considerations for microbial genome annotation.
* Be able to perform basic detection of virulence factors in a microbial genome.

The outcomes will be achieved through a series of practical exercises, looking at different datasets. The key dataset is a "mystery novel pathogen" that you will be asked to analyse. The scenario is:

> An outbreak of diarrhoea has been reported, affecting over a hundred people attending a political conference. Most have fever, severe abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea. Five have been admitted to an ICU and are in a critical condition. You have been presented with the sequencing output from what appears to be an *E. coli* strain that has been isolated from the faeces of one of the ICU patients. Over the coming days you must QC, assemble and annotate the genome sequence from this strain, looking for unusual mobile genetic elements, which should be analysed in depth.

The sample data is available under **[Preparing our data and environment]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/sequence-analysis/download-data/)**. 

This data and other data for the exercises can be found in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10018484), such as the `additional_genomes_for_qc.zip` file.

# Prerequisites

It is assumed:

* that you have access to a CLIMB-BIG-DATA notebook. If you do not, please contact the instructors.
* that you can install some simple graphical software on your local machine. 
* that you have some basic familiarity of the Linux command line (introduced in week one). 
* that you have some familiarity with genome sequencing technologies (introduced in week two). 

# Working through the submodules

* Work through the series of submodules (listed in the [programme]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/sequence-analysis/programme/)), under the guidance of the instructors.
* Within each submodule, there will be a self-contained practical exercise to complete. You are to use your CLIMB-BIG-DATA notebooks to complete these exercises. You may also need to use your local machine to install and use some of the graphical software. 
* The introductory information above each exercise will help you complete each exercise. Read the information carefully. You may need to refer to external sources of information to complete the exercises, such as internet or literature searches.
* The information in each submodule is cumulative, so it is important to work through them in order. You may need to refer back to previous modules to complete the exercises.
* You should try to make an attempt on your own (or with the help of some peers) but if you are stuck you are encouraged to ask questions of the instructors.
* There are answers for each exercise given as a link at the end of each exercise. You should only refer to these if you are really stuck, or if you have completed the exercise and want to check your answers.
* At the end of a prescribed period of time the instructor will review the exercise, and give a brief demonstration of how it should be completed.
