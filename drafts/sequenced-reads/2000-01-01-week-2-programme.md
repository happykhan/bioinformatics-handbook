_Bioinformatics tutorials led by Nabil-Fareed Alikhan_

> Much of Bioinformatics (via computing) is about building musle memory around operating a computer, and memorizing the syntax. These exercises will give you oppotunity to practice these skills, even though some these topics will have been presented in week 1.
