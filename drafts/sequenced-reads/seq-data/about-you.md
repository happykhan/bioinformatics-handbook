# Questions about you 

Looks like you have me (Nabil) for these days and into next week. It would be good to know your background and what you hope to get out of this course.

* How difficult did you find the material in week 1?
* What's your prior experience with this type of material (computing, bioinformatics, sequencing, etc.)?
* Which areas did you find easy?
* Which areas did you struggle with?
* What aspects of bioinformatics are required for your project?
* Did you tune out or were overwhelmed during week 1? 

You can either:

* Keep the responses for yourself OR 
* Email your responses to <nabil-fareed.alikhan@quadram.ac.uk> OR 
* post on the discord, OR 
* you can present your answers here in this session.
