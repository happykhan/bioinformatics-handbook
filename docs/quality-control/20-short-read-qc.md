title: Practical - Quality control for short reads
---

In this section, we will be using some example data to assess the quality of short reads. We will use two tools, FASTQE and FASTQC. We will also use some tools to trim poor quality reads (or parts of reads).

> Remember, the pKP1-NDM-1 reads are simulated reads, with minimal error. These are effectively "perfect" and will not be representative of real data. We can use this to compare with problematic data (female_oral2.fastq.gz)

### Where is the example data? 

We will use some example data, found in `~/shared-team/week2/short-read-qc`. Copy it to your home directory. 

```bash
cp -r ~/shared-team/week2/short-read-qc ~/
cd ~/short-read-qc
```

>If you are part of our 2023 cohort, we should have the sequencing data from what we did earlier in the week. See `~/shared-team/week2/sequence-data/`

**You should run tools on our sequenced data as described below and also [Kraken2 to figure out what we sequenced]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/sequencing/read-classification/)**

**If you are not using a CLIMB-BIG-DATA notebook, you will need to download the example data.**
```
wget -O female_oral2.fastq.gz https://zenodo.org/record/3977236/files/female_oral2.fastq-4143.gz?download=1
wget -O pKP1-NDM-1_R1.fastq.gz https://zenodo.org/records/10018484/files/pKP1-NDM-1_R1.fastq.gz?download=1
wget -O pKP1-NDM-1_R2.fastq.gz https://zenodo.org/records/10018484/files/pKP1-NDM-1_R2.fastq.gz?download=1
```

**female_oral2.fastq.gz**: This is a microbiome sample (16S) from a snake [Jacques et al. 2021.](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/coursesource/publications?id=2727&v=1).

### Required software

If you are not using a CLIMB-BIG-DATA notebook, you may need to install some software. 

* [FASTQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
* [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

This is how to do it via conda: 

```
conda install fastqe fastqc cutadapt -y
```

## Assess quality with FASTQC

An additional or alternative way we can check sequence quality is with [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to check whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis. We can use it, for example, to assess whether there are known adapters present in the data. We'll run it on the FASTQ files.

To run FastQC, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your data files are located. Then, use the fastqc command followed by the path to your data files. For example:

```bash
fastqc file1.fastq file2.fastq
```

You can also use wildcards to analyze multiple files at once, like this:
```bash
fastqc *.fastq
```

FastQC will process each file and generate an HTML report for each. *Are you able to open the report via the notebook file browser?*.  The reports contain various quality control metrics and visualizations. See the help via:

```bash
fastqc --help 
```


> FASTQC will also work for long reads. 

### Exercise 1: Run FASTQC

* Run FASTQC on female_oral2.fastq.gz.
* Run FASTQC on pKP1-NDM-1_R1.fastq.gz and pKP1-NDM-1_R2.fastq.gz together.
* Review and compare the HTML reports.

**Which metrics are a major difference between the two reports?**

**What is the parts of the report are missing for pKP1-NDM? Can you explain why?**

**Review each metric for female_oral2.fastq.gz, what part of each plot suggests there is a problem?**

> Remember, the pKP1-NDM-1 reads are simulated reads, with minimal error. These are effectively "perfect" and will not be representative of real data. We can use this to compare with problematic data (female_oral2.fastq.gz)

**female_oral2.fastq.gz data looks terrible, we should probably resequence it, but if we had to; how could we improve the quality?**

## Trim and filter - short reads

The quality drops in the middle of these sequences. This could cause bias in downstream analyses with these potentially incorrectly called nucleotides. Sequences must be treated to reduce bias in downstream analysis. Trimming can help to increase the number of reads the aligner or assembler are able to succesfully use, reducing the number of reads that are unmapped or unassembled. In general, quality treatments include:

* Trimming/cutting/masking sequences
    * from low quality score regions
    * beginning/end of sequence
    * removing adapters
* Filtering of sequences
    * with low mean quality score
    * too short
    * with too many ambiguous (N) bases

To accomplish this task we will use [Cutadapt](https://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200), a tool that enhances sequence quality by automating adapter trimming as well as quality control. We will:

* Trim low-quality bases from the ends. Quality trimming is done before any adapter trimming. We will set the quality threshold as 20, a commonly used threshold.
* Trim adapter with Cutadapt. For that we need to supply the sequence of the adapter. In this sample, Nextera is the adapter that was detected. We can find the sequence of the Nextera adapter on the Illumina website here `CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT`. We will trim that sequence from the 3’ end of the reads.
* Filter out sequences with length < 20 after trimming

### Exercise 3: Trim and filter

**Use cutadapt to trim the adapter sequence from the 3' end of the reads, and filter out sequences with a length less than 20 after trimming.**

```
cutadapt -q 20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT -m 20 female_oral2.fastq.gz  | gzip -c > female_oral2.trimmed.fastq.gz
```

Can you explain what each of the options does?

**Run FASTQE and FASTQC on the trimmed data and compare to the original file.**

**Does the per base sequence quality look better?**

**Is the adapter gone?**

**What can you say about some of the other metrics?**
